//! A floating origin plugin that uses integer grids to extend bevy's [`Transform`] component with
//! up to 128 bits of added precision. The plugin propagates and computes [`GlobalTransform`]s
//! relative to floating origins, making the most of 32 bit rendering precision by reducing error
//! near the camera.

//! ## Quick Reference
//!
//! - [`BigSpace`] : The root of a high precision entity hierarchy.
//! - [`FloatingOrigin`] : Position of the 32 bit rendering origin.
//! - [`Grid`] : Defines the size of a grid for its child cells.
//! - [`GridCell`] : Cell index of an entity within its parent's grid.
//! - [`GridPrecision`] : Integer precision of a grid.
//!
//! #### Spatial Hashing
//!
//! - [`GridHash`] : The spatial hash of an entity's grid cell.
//! - [`GridHashMap`] : A map for entity, grid cell, and neighbor lookups.
//! - [`GridPartition`] : Group of adjacent grid cells.
//! - [`GridPartitionMap`] : A map for finding independent partitions of entities.

//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! Objects far from the origin suffer from reduced precision, causing rendered meshes to jitter and
//! jiggle, and transformation calculations to encounter catastrophic cancellation.
//!
//! As a camera moves far from the origin, the values describing its x/y/z coordinates become large,
//! leaving less precision to the right of the decimal place. Consequently, when computing the
//! position of objects in view space, mesh vertices will be displaced due to this lost precision.
//!
//! This is a great little tool to calculate how much precision a floating point value has at a
//! given scale: <http://www.ehopkinson.com/floatprecision.html>.
//!
//! ### Possible Solutions
//!
//! There are many ways to solve this problem!
//!
//! - Periodic recentering: every time the camera moves far enough away from the origin, move it
//!   back to the origin and apply the same offset to all other entities.
//!   - Problem: Objects far from the camera will drift and accumulate error.
//!   - Problem: No fixed reference frame.
//!   - Problem: Recentering triggers change detection even for objects that did not move.
//! - Camera-relative coordinates: don't move the camera, move the world around the camera.
//!   - Problem: Objects far from the camera will drift and accumulate error.
//!   - Problem: No fixed reference frame.
//!   - Problem: Math is more complex when everything is relative to the camera.
//!   - Problem: Rotating the camera requires recomputing transforms for everything.
//!   - Problem: Camera movement triggers change detection even for objects that did not move.
//!   - Problem: Incompatible with existing plugins that use `Transform`.
//! - Double precision coordinates: Store transforms in double precision
//!   - Problem: Rendering still requires positions be in single precision, which either requires
//!     using one of the above techniques, or emulating 64 bit precision in shaders.
//!   - Problem: Updating double precision transforms is more expensive than single precision.
//!   - Problem: Computing the `GlobalTransform` is more expensive than single precision.
//!   - Problem: Size is limited to approximately the orbit of Saturn at human scales.
//!   - Problem: Incompatible with existing plugins that use `Transform`.
//! - Chunks: Place objects in a large grid, and track the grid cell they are in,
//!   - Problem: Requires a component to track the grid cell, in addition to the `Transform`.
//!   - Problem: Computing the `GlobalTransform` is more expensive than single precision.
//!
//! ### Integer Grid
//!
//! This plugin uses the last solution listed above. The most significant benefits of this method
//! over the others are:
//! - Absolute high-precision positions in space that do not change when the camera moves. The only
//!   component that is affected by precision loss is the `GlobalTransform` used for rendering. The
//!   `GridCell` and `Transform` only change when an entity moves. This is especially useful for
//!   multiplayer - the server needs a source of truth for position that doesn't drift over time.
//! - Virtually limitless volume and scale; you can work at the scale of subatomic particles, across
//!   the width of the observable universe. Double precision is downright suffocating in comparison.
//! - Uniform precision across the play area. Unlike double precision, the available precision does
//!   not decrease as you move to the edge of the play area, it is instead relative to the distance
//!   from the origin of the current grid cell.
//! - High precision coordinates are invisible if you don't need them. You can move objects using
//!   their `Transform` alone, which results in decent ecosystem compatibility.
//! - High precision is completely opt-in. If you don't add the `GridCell` component to an entity,
//!   it behaves like a normal single precision transform, with the same performance cost, yet it
//!   can exist in the high precision hierarchy. This allows you to load in GLTFs or other
//!   low-precision entity hierarchies with no added effort or cost.
//!
//! While using the [`BigSpacePlugin`], the position of entities is now defined with the [`Grid`],
//! [`GridCell`], and [`Transform`] components. The `Grid` is a large integer grid of cells;
//! entities are located within this grid as children using the `GridCell` component. Finally, the
//! `Transform` is used to position the entity relative to the center of its `GridCell`. If an
//! entity moves into a neighboring cell, its transform will be automatically recomputed relative to
//! the center of that new cell. This prevents `Transforms` from ever becoming larger than a single
//! grid cell, and thus prevents floating point precision artifacts.
//!
//! The grid adds precision to your transforms. If you are using (32-bit) `Transform`s on an `i32`
//! grid, you will have 64 bits of precision: 32 bits to address into a large integer grid, and 32
//! bits of floating point precision within a grid cell. This plugin is generic up to `i128` grids,
//! giving you up to 160 bits of precision of translation.
//!
//! `Grid`s can be nested, like `Transform`s. This allows you to define moving grids, which can make
//! certain use cases much simpler. For example, if you have a planet rotating, and orbiting around
//! its star, it would be very annoying if you had to compute this orbit and rotation for all
//! objects on the surface in high precision. Instead, you can place the planet and all objects on
//! its surface in the same grid. The motion of the planet will be inherited by all children in that
//! grid, in high precision.
//!
//! Entities at the root of bevy's entity hierarchy are not in a grid. This allows plugins from the
//! rest of the ecosystem to operate normally, such as `bevy_ui`, which relies on the built-in
//! transform propagation system. This also means that if you don't need to place entities in a
//! high-precision grid, you don't have to, as the process is opt-in. The high-precision
//! hierarchical grids are explicit. Each high-precision tree must have a [`BigSpace`] at the root,
//! with each `BigSpace` being independent. This means that each `BigSpace` has its own floating
//! origin, which allows you to do things like rendering two players on opposite ends of the
//! universe in split screen.
//!
//! ### Floating Origin
//!
//! All of the above applies to the entity marked with the [`FloatingOrigin`] component. The
//! floating origin can be any high-precision entity in a `BigSpace`, it doesn't need to be a
//! camera. The only thing special about the entity marked as the floating origin, is that it is
//! used to compute the [`GlobalTransform`] of all other entities in that `BigSpace`. To an outside
//! observer, every high-precision entity within a `BigSpace` is confined to a box the size of a
//! grid cell - like a game of *Asteroids*. Only once you render the `BigSpace` from the point of
//! view of the floating origin, by calculating their `GlobalTransform`s, do entities appear very
//! distant from the floating origin.
//!
//! As described above. the `GlobalTransform` of all entities is computed relative to the floating
//! origin's grid cell. Because of this, entities very far from the origin will have very large,
//! imprecise positions. However, this is always relative to the camera (floating origin), so these
//! artifacts will always be too far away to be seen, no matter where the camera moves. Because this
//! only affects the `GlobalTransform` and not the `Transform`, this also means that entities will
//! never permanently lose precision just because they were far from the origin at some point. The
//! lossy calculation only occurs when computing the `GlobalTransform` of entities, the high
//! precision `GridCell` and `Transform` are not affected.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To start using this plugin, you will first need to choose how big your world should be! Do you
//! need an i8, or an i128? See [`GridPrecision`] for more details and documentation.
//!
//! 1. Add the [`BigSpacePlugin`] to your `App`
//! 2. Spawn a [`BigSpace`] with [`spawn_big_space`](BigSpaceCommands::spawn_big_space), and add
//!    entities to it.
//! 3. Add the [`FloatingOrigin`] to your active camera in the [`BigSpace`].
//!
//! To add more levels to the hierarchy, you can use [`Grid`]s, which themselves can contain
//! high-precision spatial entities. Grids have the same propagation behavior as `Transform`s, but
//! with higher precision.
//!
//! Take a look at the [`Grid`] component for some useful helper methods. The component defines the
//! scale of the grid, which is very important when computing distances between objects in different
//! cells. Note that the root [`BigSpace`] also has a [`Grid`] component.
//!
//! # Moving Entities
//!
//! For the most part, you can update the position of entities normally while using this plugin, and
//! it will automatically handle the tricky bits. If you move an entity too far from the center of
//! its grid cell, the plugin will automatically move it into the correct cell for you. However,
//! there is one big caveat:
//!
//! **Avoid setting position absolutely, instead prefer applying a relative delta**
//!
//! Instead of:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! transform.translation = a_huge_imprecise_position;
//! ```
//!
//! do:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let delta = new_pos - old_pos;
//! transform.translation += delta;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Absolute Position
//!
//! If you are updating the position of an entity with absolute positions, and the position exceeds
//! the bounds of the entity's grid cell, the floating origin plugin will recenter that entity into
//! its new cell. Every time you update that entity, you will be fighting with the plugin as it
//! constantly recenters your entity. This can especially cause problems with camera controllers
//! which may not expect the large discontinuity in position as an entity moves between cells.
//!
//! The other reason to avoid this is you will likely run into precision issues! This plugin exists
//! because single precision is limited, and the larger the position coordinates get, the less
//! precision you have.
//!
//! However, if you have something that must not accumulate error, like the orbit of a planet, you
//! can instead do the orbital calculation (position as a function of time) to compute the absolute
//! position of the planet with high precision, then directly compute the [`GridCell`] and
//! [`Transform`] of that entity using [`Grid::translation_to_grid`].
//!
//! # Next Steps
