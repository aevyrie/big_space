// TODO: Performance
//
// Improve the data locality of neighbors. Completely random access in a hot loop is probably
// unlikely, we should instead optimize for the case of wanting to look up neighbors of the current
// cell. We know neighbor lookups are a common need, and are a bottleneck currently.
//
//  - To do this, we could store neighboring entities together in the same entry, so they fill the
//    cache line during a lookup. Getting a neighbor in the current entry should then be super fast,
//    as it is already loaded on the cache.
//  - Not sure what the group size would be, probably depends on a bunch of factors, though will be
//    limited by common cache line sizes in practice, the decision is probably between whether to
//    group 2x2x2 or 3x3x3 blocks of cells into the same entry.
//  - Considering the entity hash set is stored on the heap, it might also make sense to group all
//    of these into a single collection. Iterating over all neighbors would then only need to access
//    this single hash set, and scan through it linear, instead of grabbing 8 (2x2x2) or 27 (3x3x3)
//    independent sets each at a different memory location.
//      - Not sure how you would efficiently partition this for each cell however. It could be a
//        hashmap whose value is the cell? Iterating over the entities in a single cell would then
//        require filtering out other cells. This might not be a big deal because iteration go brrr.
//        Unique insertion would be an issue though, e.g. the hash set for each cell ensures the
//        entity is unique.
//
//  - Another wild idea is to not change the hashmap structure at all, but store all entries in
//    Z-order in *another* collection (BTreeMap?) to improve locality for sequential lookups of
//    spatial neighbors. Would ordering cause hitches with insertions?
