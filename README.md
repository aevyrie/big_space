## Highlights

- Enough precision to render proton-sized meshes across the observable universe.
- Uses `Transform`, making it compatible with most of the Bevy ecosystem.
- No added dependencies.
- Absolute coordinates without drift, unlike camera-relative or periodic recentering solutions.
- Chunks the world into integer grids, from `i8` up to `i128`.
- Grids can be nested.
- Spatial hashing for fast grid cell lookups and neighbor search.
- Spatial partitioning to group sets of disconnected entities.
- 3-5x faster than Bevy's transform propagation for wide hierarchies.
- ðŸ‘‰ [Extensive documentation you should read.](https://docs.rs/big_space)
